# JPG-to-PNG-converter
A simple script that converts JPG images to PNG


This is a simple script that uses Pillow (Python Imaging Library fork for python3) to convert JPGs to PNGs within a folder.

To run:
1.   Open the cmd/terminal to the folder where "convert_JPGtoPNG.py" is and make sure it has a subfolder with the JPG/JPGs that you wish to convert to PNG.

2.   Type: "python convert_JPGtoPNG.py 'existing_images_folder/' 'new_images_folder/'" with no quotation marks.
2.5. Change "existing_images_folder" and "new_images_folder" to the correct folder names. The output folder doesn't have to be an existing folder, since the script will create it with the name that you have written into the cmd/terminal (for example "new_images_folder").

3.   Press ENTER and your JPG images have been converted into PNGs and saved in the new folder.
